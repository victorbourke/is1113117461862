					</center>
					<br>
					The term "cloud computing" is everywhere. In the simplest terms, cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive. The cloud is just a metaphor for the Internet. There are 4 main classifications of cloud computing, Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Communication as a Service (CaaS)

						SaaS
					</center>
					<br>
					Software as a service (SaaS) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. It is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software". SaaS is typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser. SaaS has become a common delivery model for many business applications, including office software and messaging software.

CaaS could include unified communications, broadcasting, individual calls (voice and video), conferencing (voice and video), voice over IP (VoIP), messaging, and so on.
