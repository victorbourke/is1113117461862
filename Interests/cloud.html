            <div class="section" id="cloud1"><div class="text"><div class="justify"><center>About</center><br/>The term "cloud computing" is everywhere. In the simplest terms, cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive. The cloud is just a metaphor for the Internet. There are 4 main classifications of cloud computing, 
            Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Communication as a Service (CaaS)</div></div></div>    
            <div class="section" id="cloud2"><div class="text"><div class="justify"><center>SaaS</center><br/>Software as a service (SaaS) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. It is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software". SaaS is typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser. SaaS has become a common delivery model for many business applications, including office software and messaging software.</div></div></div>
        	<div class="section" id="cloud3"><div class="text"><div class="justify"><center>PaaS</center><br/>Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.</div></div></div>
        	<div class="section" id="cloud4"><div class="text"><div class="justify"><center>IaaS</center><br/>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to dereference various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc.</div></div></div>
        	<div class="section" id="cloud5"><div class="text"><div class="justify"><center>CaaS</center><br/>Communications as a Service (CaaS) provides Software as a Service (SaaS) for communications. There is no standard specification as to what is included in CaaS. Implementations vary. CaaS could include unified communications, broadcasting, individual calls (voice and video), conferencing (voice and video), voice over IP (VoIP), messaging, and so on.</div></div></div>
